# Programming snippets and reference for various things.
Things I write down and helpful concepts in my journey as a programmer.

This is by no means a complete list of any one topic. Some parts may be at a beginner level while other parts are more advanced. This is really just random Snippets/references in programming that I have found useful in various situations.
