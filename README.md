# Programming snippets and reference for various things.
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sreeise/ProgrammingSnippets.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sreeise/ProgrammingSnippets)

Things I write down and helpful concepts in my journey as a programmer.

This is by no means a complete list of any one topic. Some parts may be at a beginner level while other parts are more advanced. 
This is really just random snippets/references in programming that I have found useful in various situations.

The Java subdirectory is tested on Travis CI. This is mainly because the Java subdirectory, besides the Rust
subdirectory, is the largest and includes the most tests.
