# Programming snippets and reference for various things.
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sreeise/ProgrammingSnippets.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sreeise/ProgrammingSnippets)

Things I write down and helpful concepts in my journey as a programmer.

This is by no means a complete list of any one topic. Some parts may be at a beginner level while other parts are more advanced. 
This is really just random snippets/references in programming that I have found useful in various situations.

The Java subdirectory is tested on Travis CI. This is mainly because the Java subdirectory, besides the Rust
subdirectory, is the largest and includes the most tests. I may update this later to include multiple languages.

### Issues
If you find something is wrong with any of the code please file an issue making sure to adhere to the following criteria:

For outdated code that could be updated:
1. Make sure that the specific language version you are using is the same as the one used in this code base. For instance,
the Java version used here is 1.8 and C++ uses C++14. Do not file an issue for specific code to be updated to use features 
in a later version. Rather, if you feel that a language version is too outdated then file an issue to update the language version.
2. If the language version is the same then follow the process below for code issues.
3. Note that I periodically update the Rust language version and code.

For code issues:
1. Describe the issue and how you came to this conclusion. If you can try to provide some type of proof for why the code is wrong.
2. If possible, provide a solution by making a pull request for this issue. Also update any tests or write a new test if possible. I will
still accept code that doesn't have a test in most cases.
