# Rust Standard Library Collections

Vector

    A vector allows you to store a variable number of values next to each other.

String    
    
    A string is a collection of characters. We’ve mentioned the String type previously, 
    but in this chapter we’ll talk about it in depth.

HashMap    
    
    A hash map allows you to associate a value with a particular key. It’s a particular 
    implementation of the more general data structure called a map.
