   How would you measure the time spent in a context switch?

   A context switch is the time spent switching between two processes (i.e., bringing
   a waiting process into execution and sending and executing a process into
   waiting/terminated state.) This happens in multitasking. Th operating system must
   bring the state information of waiting processes into memory and save the state
   information of the currently running process.
