# Logarithms

A logarithm is the power to which a number must be raised in order
to get some other number.

We often see logarithms in runtime complexity such as O(log N).

### Logarithmic rules

There are a few rules not listed here but these are some of the basics:

    br = a is the equivalent to logb a=r (This is the definition of a logarithm.)

    log (P*Q) = log P + log Q
    
    log (P/Q) = log P - log Q
    
    log (Pt) = t *log P
    
    log (1/a) = -log a
