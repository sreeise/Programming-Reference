# Java autoboxing and auto-unboxing.

Type parameters have to be instantiated as references types, so java has a special mechanism
to allow generic code to be used with primitive types: Boolean, Byte, Character, Double, Float, 
Integer, Long, and Short correspond to boolean, byte, char, double, float, int, long, and short, 
respectively. Java automatically converts between these reference types and the corresponding 
primitive typesâ€”in assignments, method arguments, and arithmetic/logic expressions.

Automatically casting a primitive type to a wrapper type is known as autoboxing, and automatically 
casting a wrapper type to a primitive type is known as auto-unboxing
